For example, if the function receives "14.5" as the input "value", it should return 15, while if it receives "-14.5", it should return -15 as these are the integers furthest from zero in both cases.\n    \'\'\'', 'def closest_integer(value):\n    \'\'\'\n    Develop a function named \'closest_integer\' that takes as input a string \'value\'. This string represents a numerical value. The function\'s responsibility is to convert this string into a float, and then determine the nearest integer to this float value. \n\n    If the float value falls exactly in the middle of two integers (i.e., the decimal part is .5), the function should round it away from zero. This means that if the float is positive, the function should round up to the next higher integer. If the float is negative, it should round down to the next lower integer. \n\n    The function should finally return the nearest integer, after the appropriate rounding operations have been performed.\n\n    Examples\n    >>> closest_integer("10")\n    10\n    >>> closest_integer("15.3")\n    15\n    >>> closest_integer("14.5")\n    15\n    >>> closest_integer("-14.5")\n    -15\n\n    Note:\n    The concept of rounding \'away from zero\' means that if the given numerical value is exactly halfway between two integers, the function should return the integer that is further from zero. For instance, if the input is "14.5", the function should return 15, not 14. Similarly, for "-14.5", it should return -15, not -14. \n    \'\'\'\n', 'def closest_integer(value):\n    \'\'\'\n    Define a function called \'closest_integer\' that takes an argument \'value\'. This argument is a string that represents a numerical value. The function needs to convert this string into a numerical form, calculate its closest integer value, and return it. \n\n    The closest integer is calculated by examining the decimal portion of the number. If the decimal portion is less than 0.5, the function should round down to the nearest whole number. If the decimal portion is 0.5 or greater, the function should round up to the nearest whole number. \n\n    Special case to note: If the number is equidistant from two integers (for example, 14.5 is equidistant from 14 and 15), the function should round it away from zero. This means that if the fractional part of the number is exactly 0.5, the function should return the integer that is further from zero. For example, \'closest_integer("14.5")\' should return 15 and \'closest_integer("-14.5")\' should return -15.\n\n    Examples\n    >>> closest_integer("10")\n    10\n    >>> closest_integer("15.3")\n    15\n    >>> closest_integer("14.5")\n    15\n    >>> closest_integer("-14.5")\n    -15\n    \'\'\'\n', 'def closest_integer(value):\n    \'\'\'\n    This function is named "closest_integer". Its purpose is to accept a single argument, referred to as \'value\', which is a string representation of a number (both integers and floating-point numbers are acceptable). The function then computes and returns the closest whole number (integer) to the input value. \n\n    If the floating-point number is equidistant from two integers, the function applies a special rule of rounding away from zero. This means that if the input number is exactly halfway between two integers, the function will return the integer that is further from zero. \n\n    In Python, a function call looks like this:\n    >>> closest_integer("10")\n    10\n    >>> closest_integer("15.3")\n    15\n\n    A few more examples to illustrate the rounding away from zero rule:\n    If the input string represents the number "14.5", the function will return 15, because 15 is further from zero than 14. Similarly, for "-14.5", the function will return -15, as -15 is further from zero than -14.\n    \'\'\'\n'], ['def construct_stone_pile(n):\n    """\n    The function \'construct_stone_pile\' takes a single parameter:\n    - n: a positive integer that represents the total number of levels in the pile of stones.\n\n    The function constructs a pile of stones with \'n\' levels such that:\n    - The first level of the pile has exactly \'n\' stones.\n    - For subsequent levels, the number of stones depends on whether \'n\' is an even or odd number.\n      If \'n\' is an odd number, the next level will have the next sequential odd number of stones.\n      If \'n\' is an even number, the next level will have the next sequential even number of stones.\n\n    The function returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of stones at each level of the pile. \n    The element at index \'i\' in the list corresponds to the number of stones in the (i+1)th level of the stone pile.\n\n    For instance:\n    >>> construct_stone_pile(3)\n    [3, 5, 7]\n\n    In this example, the pile has 3 levels.

Even though \'a\' is higher than \'b\', the function still generates even numbers in ascending order.\n\n    If the function is called as generate_even_numbers(10, 14), it should return an empty list []. This is because there are no even integers between 10 and 14, not including 10 and 14.\n    """\n', 'def generate_integers(a, b):\n    """\n    This function, \'generate_integers\', accepts two positive integer inputs: \'a\' and \'b\'. It is designed to identify and return all even-valued integers located within the inclusive range between \'a\' and \'b\'. The function disregards the order of the input pairs and as such, the output will always be in ascending order regardless of whether \'a\' is greater than, equal to, or less than \'b\'.\n\n    Specifically, the function iterates through the range of integers from the smallest to the largest of the two inputs, tests each integer for parity (evenness), and appends any even integers to a list, which it then returns.\n\n    However, it is important to note that this function considers only single-digit integers in the range from \'a\' to \'b\'. Therefore, if the range contains no single-digit even integers (as in the example where \'a\' is 10 and \'b\' is 14), the function will return an empty list.\n\n    For example:\n    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    This example returns a list of all single-digit even integers from 2 to 8.\n\n    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    This example returns the same list as the previous example, demonstrating the function\'s agnosticism to input order.\n\n    generate_integers(10, 14) => []\n    This example returns an empty list since there are no single-digit even integers between 10 and 14.\n    """\n', 'def generate_integers(a, b):\n    """\n    This function takes as input two positive integers, \'a\' and \'b\'. It is designed to return a list of even integers that fall within the range specified by \'a\' and \'b\', inclusive of both these integers. The output list is sorted in ascending order, regardless of the order in which \'a\' and \'b\' are provided.\n\n    The function works as follows: If \'a\' is less than \'b\', it generates a sequence of integers from \'a\' to \'b\'. If \'b\' is less than \'a\', it generates a sequence from \'b\' to \'a\'. It then filters out the even integers from this sequence. However, if none of the integers in the range (inclusive) are even, the function returns an empty list.\n\n    Example scenarios:\n    generate_integers(2, 8) should return [2, 4, 6, 8] - All even numbers between 2 and 8, inclusive.\n    generate_integers(8, 2) should return [2, 4, 6, 8] - All even numbers between 2 and 8, inclusive.\n    generate_integers(10, 14) should return [] - No even numbers exist between 10 and 14 when excluding 10 and 14.\n    """\n', 'def generate_integers(a, b):\n    """\n    This function `generate_integers(a, b)` is designed to accept two positive integers `a` and `b` as input arguments. These integers can be in either ascending or descending order. The function should then return a list of all the even numbers that exist within the range defined by `a` and `b` (inclusive). The resulting list should be arranged in ascending order. \n\n    Note that the function should return an empty list if there are no even numbers that fall within the given range. \n\n    For example:\n    generate_integers(2, 8) should return [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(8, 2) should return [2, 4, 6, 8], order of input arguments doesn\'t affect the output\n    generate_integers(10, 14) should return [], since there are no even numbers within the range 10 and 14, exclusive.\n    """\n']]
