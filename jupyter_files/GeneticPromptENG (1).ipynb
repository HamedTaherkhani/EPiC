The set of prime numbers starts with 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17 and continues indefinitely. \\n\\n    Hexadecimal digits, on the other hand, are the sixteen digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F, where each letter from A to F represents a decimal number from 10 to 15 respectively. \\n\\n    Therefore, for the purposes of this function, the digits of interest are: 2, 3, 5, 7, B (which is the hexadecimal representation of the decimal number 11), and D (which is the hexadecimal representation of the decimal number 13).\\n\\n    You can safely assume that the input string \\'num\\' will always be a correct hexadecimal number or an empty string, and that any hexadecimal digits from A to F will always be given in uppercase.\\n\\n    Here are a few examples to illustrate the function\\'s expected behaviour:\\n\\n    For num = \"AB\", the output should be 1 because B is the only prime number.\\n    For num = \"1077E\", the output should be 2 since it has two prime numbers (7 and 7).\\n    For num = \"ABED1A33\", the output should be 4 because there are four prime numbers (B, D, 3 and 3).\\n    For num = \"123456789ABCDEF0\", the output', 'def hex_key(num):\\n    \"\"\"\\n    In this exercise, you are required to create a function named \\'hex_key\\'.

In this context, a prime number is defined as a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers together.

Its purpose is to split the string into a list of words and return the resultant list. \\n\\n    The string splitting process is implemented as follows: initially, the function splits the string on the basis of whitespace characters. In case the string does not contain any whitespace characters, the function attempts to split the string using commas (\\',\\') as delimiters. \\n\\n    However, if the function encounters a string devoid of both whitespace and comma characters, it resorts to a different approach to return a value. In this scenario, the function counts the number of lowercase letters in the string that have an odd ordinal position in the English alphabet and returns this count. \\n\\n    For the purpose of this function, the ordinal positions are assumed to start from 0.

If whitespaces are found, the function will split the string at these whitespaces and return a list of words. Each element in the list represents a word from the original string that was separated by a whitespace.\\n\\n    If the string does not contain any whitespaces, the function will then check for commas \\',\\'. If commas are found, the function will split the string at these commas and return a list of words, similar to the process for whitespaces.\\n\\n    If the string does not contain any whitespaces or commas, the function will then count the number of lower-case letters that have an odd order in the English alphabet.

It counts the number of lowercase letters in the string that have an odd index value when considered in alphabetical order (e.g., \\'a\\' = 0, \\'b\\' = 1, ..., \\'z\\' = 25).

A \"good\" string is defined as one where all parentheses are balanced. This means that for every open parenthesis, there is a corresponding close parenthesis that follows it in the sequence, and no close parenthesis appears before its matching open parenthesis. For instance, the string \\'(())()\\' is considered good because every open parenthesis is matched with a close parenthesis in the correct order, whereas the string \\'())\\' is not good because there is a close parenthesis without a preceding matching open parenthesis.\\n\\n    The function returns \\'Yes\\' if there exists a way to concatenate the two strings to form a good string, and \\'No\\' otherwise.\\n\\n    Input:\\n    - lst (list of str): A list containing two strings, where each string is composed of \\'(\\' and/or \\')\\'.\\n\\n    Output:\\n    - (str): Returns \\'Yes\\' if the strings can be concatenated in any order to form a good string, and \\'No\\' if not.\\n\\n    Examples:\\n    - match_parens([\\'()(\\', \\')\\']) should return \\'Yes\\' because concatenating the first string with the second (\\'()(\\' + \\')\\') results in \\'()()\\', which is a good string.\\n    - match_parens([\\')\\', \\')\\']) should return \\'No\\' because no matter how you concatenate these strings, you cannot form a good string.\\n\\n    Test Cases:\\n    1. match_parens([\\'()(\\', \\')\\']) -> \\'Yes\\'\\n    2. match_parens([\\')\\', \\')\\']) -> \\'No\\'\\n    3. match_parens([\\'(\\', \\'\\']) -> \\'No\\'\\n    4. match_parens([\\'\\', \\'\\']) -> \\'Yes\\'\\n    5. match_parens([\\'(()\\', \\'())\\']) -> \\'Yes\\'\\n    6. match_parens([\\')(\\', \\'\\']) -> \\'No\\'\\n    7. match_parens([\\')(\\', \\')\\']) -> \\'No\\'\\n    8. match_parens([\\'(\\', \\')\\']) -> \\'Yes\\'\\n    9. match_parens([\\')())\\', \\'(()(\\']) -> \\'No\\'\\n    10. match_parens([\\'(()(()\\', \\'))())\\']) -> \\'No\\'\\n\\n    Exceptional or Edge Cases:\\n    - When one or both strings are empty.
