Hence, it repeatedly subtracts the smaller number from the larger one until one of the numbers becomes zero, at which point the other number is the GCD.\n    \n    Input:\n    - a (int): The first integer.\n    - b (int): The second integer.\n    \n    Output:\n    - int: The greatest common divisor of a and b.\n    \n    Exceptional or Edge Cases:\n    1. If either of the input integers is 0, the GCD is the absolute value of the non-zero integer, since any number is divisible by 0. This is based on the convention that the GCD(0, n) = n for any integer n.\n    2. If both input integers are 0, the function will return 0, as the GCD is undefined in mathematics, but by convention, it can be considered 0 for practical purposes.\n    3. For negative input values, the GCD is calculated as if the values were positive, since the GCD is always a positive integer by definition. The function does not need to explicitly handle negative inputs differently, as the algorithm naturally accounts for this by using subtraction and eventually reaching a non-negative GCD.\n    \n    Example Test Cases:\n    >>> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)\n    1\n    >>> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)\n    5\n    >>> greatest_common_divisor(0, 10)\n    10\n    >>> greatest_common_divisor(10, 0)\n    10\n    >>> greatest_common_divisor(0, 0)\n    0\n    >>> greatest_common_divisor(-25, 15)\n    5\n    >>> greatest_common_divisor(25, -15)\n    5\n    >>> greatest_common_divisor(-25, -15)\n    5\n    >>> greatest_common_divisor(1, 1)\n    1\n    >>> greatest_common_divisor(2, 4)\n    2\n    >>> greatest_common_divisor(18, 24)\n    6\n    >>> greatest_common_divisor(1071, 462)\n    21\n    \n    These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including positive and negative integers, zeros as input, and both small and large integers.

The output list begins with the minimum value from the input list, followed by the maximum value of the remaining integers, then the minimum of the remaining integers, and this pattern continues until all integers from the input list have been included in the output list.\n    \n    Input:\n    - lst (list of int): A list of integers which can include positive, negative, and zero values. The list can also be empty.\n    \n    Output:\n    - list of int: A new list of integers sorted in the described strange order.\n    \n    The strange sorting algorithm alternates between selecting the minimum and maximum values from the remaining unsorted integers until all integers are sorted into the new list. This sorting method creates a pattern where the smallest and largest values are arranged in an alternating sequence.\n    \n    Exceptional or edge cases include:\n    - If the input list is empty, the function returns an empty list.\n    - If the input list contains integers with the same value (e.g., all elements are equal), the output list will have the same values in the same order since the minimum and maximum values are the same at each step.\n    - If the input list contains only one integer, the output list will be the same as the input list since there are no other integers to alternate between.\n    \n    Examples:\n    strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 4, 2, 3] # Standard case with distinct integers.\n    strange_sort_list([5, 5, 5, 5]) == [5, 5, 5, 5] # Edge case with all integers being the same.\n    strange_sort_list([]) == [] # Edge case with an empty input list.\n    strange_sort_list([-2, 0, 1, 3]) == [-2, 3, 0, 1] # Case with negative and positive integers.\n    strange_sort_list([7]) == [7] # Edge case with a single integer.\n    strange_sort_list([-5, -3, -1, -4]) == [-5, -1, -4, -3] # Case with all negative integers.\n    strange_sort_list([9, 7, 5, 3, 1]) == [1, 9, 3, 7, 5] # Case with descending order input.\n    \n    The function iterates through the input list, alternating between finding and removing the minimum and maximum values until all elements have been processed.

Otherwise, it returns False.\n    \n    Exceptional or Edge Cases:\n    - If the list is empty, it is considered balanced (a palindrome), and since its sum is 0, which is less than any positive maximum possible weight, the function will return True.\n    - If the list contains only one element, it is automatically considered balanced, and the function will return True if the element is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight.\n    - If the maximum possible weight is negative, the function will always return False, as the sum of the elements of a non-empty list cannot be negative.\n    \n    Examples:\n    will_it_fly([1, 2], 5) ➞ False \n    # 1+2 is less than the maximum possible weight, but it's unbalanced.\n\n    will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1) ➞ False\n    # It's balanced, but 3+2+3 is more than the maximum possible weight.\n\n    will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9) ➞ True\n    # 3+2+3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.\n\n    will_it_fly([3], 5) ➞ True\n    # 3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.\n    \n    will_it_fly([], 10) ➞ True\n    # Empty list is considered balanced, and its sum is 0, which is less than the maximum possible weight.\n    \n    will_it_fly([5], -1) ➞ False\n    # Single element is balanced, but the maximum possible weight is negative, which is not allowed.\n    \n    will_it_fly([1, 2, 3, 2, 1], 0) ➞ False\n    # It's balanced, but the sum (9) is not less than or equal to the maximum possible weight (0).\n    \n    The function provides a simple yet effective way to determine if an object, based on its weight distribution and total weight, meets the criteria for being capable of flight.\n    '''\n",

The function returns either a list of strings or an integer, based on the content of the input txt. The purpose of this function is to process a given string in the following manner:\n    \n    1. The primary operation of the function is to split the input string into a list of words. The function follows a hierarchical approach for splitting:\n       - First, it attempts to split the string based on whitespace characters. Whitespace characters include spaces, tabs, etc.\n       - If the input string does not contain any whitespace characters, the function then attempts to split the string based on commas (\',\').\n       - If the input string contains neither whitespace characters nor commas, the function proceeds to a different operation.\n    \n    2. In the case where the input string does not contain whitespaces or commas, the function calculates the number of lowercase letters within the input string that have an odd order in the English alphabet. The alphabet order is zero-indexed, meaning \'a\' has an order of 0, \'b\' has an order of 1, and so on up to \'z\' which has an order of 25. A letter is counted if its order is odd (1, 3, 5, ..., 25).\n    \n    3. The function returns a list of strings if it was able to split the input string based on either whitespaces or commas. If it performed the count of specific lowercase letters, it returns an integer representing that count.\n    \n    Exceptional or Edge Cases:\n    - If the input string is empty, the function returns an empty list since there are no whitespaces, commas, or letters to process.\n    - If the input string contains only whitespaces or commas, but no actual words or letters, the function returns a list with empty strings as elements for each whitespace or comma found.\n    - If the input string consists entirely of uppercase letters that would have an odd order if they were lowercase, these are not counted since the function specifically looks for lowercase letters.\n    \n    Examples:\n    - split_words("Hello world!") ➞ ["Hello", "world!"]\n    - split_words("Hello,world!") ➞ ["Hello", "world!"]\n    - split_words("abcdef") == 3  # \'b\', \'d\', \'f\' are the lowercase letters with odd orders\n    - split_words("") ➞ []  # Empty string input\n    - split_words(",, ,") ➞ ["", "", "", ""]  # String with only commas and whitespaces\n    - split_words("ABCDEF") ➞ 0  # Uppercase string without odd order lowercase letters\n    - split_words("a,b,c,d,e,f") ➞ ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"]  # String with commas and lowercase letters\n    \n    The function provides a versatile way of processing strings for different purposes, making it useful for tasks that require conditional string splitting or counting specific characters based on their properties.\n    \'\'\'\n',

The function then processes this string in a specific\n    manner to produce either a list of strings or an integer as output, depending on the content of the input string.\n\n    The processing steps are as follows:\n    1. The function first checks if the input string contains any whitespace characters (e.g., spaces, tabs, etc.). If\n       whitespace is found, the string is split based on these whitespace characters, and a list of the resulting substrings\n       is returned. Each substring represents a word or sequence of characters that was separated by whitespace in the\n       original string.\n    \n    2. If no whitespace characters are found, the function then checks for the presence of commas (\',\'). If commas are\n       present, the string is split based on these commas, and a list of the resulting substrings is returned. This scenario\n       applies to strings where words or phrases are comma-separated without spaces.\n    \n    3. If the input string contains neither whitespace characters nor commas, the function calculates the number of\n       lowercase letters within the string that have an odd order in the English alphabet. The order is determined by the\n       zero-based index of each letter in the alphabet, with \'a\' being 0, \'b\' being 1, and so on up to \'z\' being 25. A letter\n       has an odd order if its index is odd (e.g., \'b\', \'d\', \'f\', etc.). The function then returns the count of such letters\n       in the input string.\n\n    Exceptional or Edge Cases:\n    - If the input string is empty, the function will return an empty list since there are no characters to process\n      according to the rules described above.\n    - If the input string consists solely of commas or whitespace characters, the function returns a list containing\n      empty strings corresponding to the splits. For example, ",,," would return ["", "", ""] and "   " would return\n      ["", "", ""], assuming three commas or spaces respectively.\n    - For the calculation of lowercase letters with an odd order, uppercase letters and non-alphabetical characters\n      are ignored. This means that a string like "ABCDefg" would be considered to have two lowercase letters (\'e\' and \'g\')\n      with odd orders.\n\n    Examples:\n    - split_words("Hello world!") ➞ ["Hello", "world!"]\n    - split_words("Hello,world!") ➞ ["Hello", "world!"]\n    - split_words("abcdef") ➞ 3\n    - split_words("") ➞ []\n    - split_words(",,") ➞ ["", ""]\n    - split_words("   ") ➞ ["", "", ""]\n    - split_words("ABCDefg") ➞ 2\n    - split_words("a,b,c,d,e,f") ➞ ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"]\n    - split_words("spaces  and,commas,combined") ➞ ["spaces", "and,commas,combined"]\n    - split_words("noSpacesOrCommasJustOddLetters") ➞ 12\n\n    The function effectively handles various formats of textual input to either separate words based on common delimiters\n    or to perform a specific count of characters based on their properties, thus providing versatile string processing\n    capabilities.\n    \'\'\'\n',

The function returns either a list of strings or an integer based on the content of the input string.\n    The primary operation of this function is to analyze the input string and split it into a list of words. The splitting criteria are as follows:\n    1. The function first checks for the presence of whitespace characters in the input string. If whitespace exists, the string is split based on these characters, and the resulting list of words is returned.\n    2. If no whitespace characters are found, the function then checks for commas (\',\'). If commas are present, the string is split based on commas, and the resulting list of words is returned.\n    3. In the absence of both whitespace characters and commas, the function calculates the number of lowercase letters within the string that have an odd order in the English alphabet (considering \'a\' as having an order of 0, \'b\' as 1, and so on up to \'z\' as 25). The function then returns this count as an integer.\n    \n    It\'s important to note that the function does not perform input validation and focuses solely on the specified criteria for splitting the string or calculating the count of specific letters.\n    \n    Exceptional or edge cases include:\n    - Strings that only contain uppercase letters or symbols will result in the function returning either an empty list (if split by whitespace or commas) or 0 (if counting odd-order lowercase letters), depending on the input.\n    - An empty string as input will return an empty list if the function attempts to split it, or 0 if it proceeds to count letters, as there are no characters to evaluate.\n    \n    Examples:\n    - split_words("Hello world!") ➞ ["Hello", "world!"]\n    - split_words("Hello,world!") ➞ ["Hello", "world!"]\n    - split_words("abcdef") == 3 (Letters \'b\', \'d\', and \'f\' have odd orders 1, 3, and 5 respectively)\n    - split_words("A B C") ➞ ["A", "B", "C"] (Split based on whitespace)\n    - split_words("A,B,C") ➞ ["A", "B", "C"] (Split based on commas)\n    - split_words("") ➞ [] (Empty string input results in an empty list)\n    - split_words("12345") == 0 (No lowercase letters present, returns 0)\n    - split_words("a,e,i,o,u") ➞ [\'a\', \'e\', \'i\', \'o\', \'u\'] (Vowels split based on commas)\n    - split_words("bcdf") == 4 (All letters have odd orders: 1, 2, 3, and 5)\n    \n    This comprehensive description and examples should help in understanding the functionality and edge cases of the split_words function.\n    \'\'\'\n',

It processes this input string in a specific order of precedence to produce either a list of strings or an integer as output, depending on the content of the input string.\n    \n    The function operates in the following manner:\n    1. It first checks if the input string contains any whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, etc.). If whitespace is found, the string is split at these points, and a list of the resulting substrings is returned. This list will contain the words or phrases that were separated by whitespace in the input string.\n    \n    2. If no whitespace is detected, the function then checks for the presence of commas (\',\'). If commas are found, the string is split at these points, similar to the whitespace, and a list of the resulting substrings is returned. This allows the function to handle CSV (comma-separated values) formatted strings effectively.\n    \n    3. If the input string contains neither whitespace nor commas, the function proceeds to count the number of lowercase letters within the string that have an odd order in the English alphabet. Here, the order is determined by the zero-based index of the letter in the alphabet (e.g., \'a\' is 0, \'b\' is 1, ..., \'z\' is 25). A letter has an odd order if its index is an odd number. The function then returns this count as an integer.\n    \n    Edge cases and exceptional scenarios:\n    - If the input string is empty, the function will return an empty list since there are no characters to split or count.\n    - If the input string consists solely of whitespace or commas, the function will return a list containing empty strings corresponding to the number of splits. For example, ",," would result in ["", "", ""].\n    - For the purpose of counting lowercase letters with an odd order, uppercase letters are not considered. This means that a string containing only uppercase letters will result in a count of 0.\n    \n    Examples:\n    - split_words("Hello world!") ➞ ["Hello", "world!"]\n    - split_words("Hello,world!") ➞ ["Hello", "world!"]\n    - split_words("abcdef") == 3\n    - split_words("") ➞ []\n    - split_words(",,") ➞ ["", "", ""]\n    - split_words("ABCDEF") == 0  # Since uppercase letters are not considered for counting\n    - split_words("a, b, c, d, e, f") ➞ ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"]  # Commas cause the split before considering letter order\n    - split_words("   ") ➞ ["", "", "", ""]  # Only whitespace results in empty strings\n    - split_words("a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k") == 6  # \'b\', \'d\', \'f\', \'h\', \'j\' are the lowercase letters with odd order, hence count is 5\n    \n    The function is designed to handle strings in various formats and return meaningful output based on the content and structure of the input. It is particularly useful for parsing strings that may contain words or values separated by common delimiters like spaces or commas, as well as for analyzing strings based on specific character properties.\n    \'\'\'\n'],

If the array contains one or more zeros, the sign product will be 0, since multiplying by zero results in zero.\n\n    There are several edge cases to consider:\n    - If the array contains only one number, the output will be the magnitude of that number multiplied by its sign (1, -1, or 0).\n    - If all numbers in the array are positive, the output will be the sum of the numbers, as the sign product will be 1.\n    - If all numbers in the array are negative, the output will depend on whether there is an odd or even number of numbers. If odd, the sign product will be -1, resulting in the negative of the sum of their magnitudes. If even, the sign product will be 1, resulting in the sum of their magnitudes.\n    - If the array contains zeros, the output will always be 0, regardless of the signs or magnitudes of the other numbers, since the sign product will be 0.\n    - If the array is empty, the function returns None, as specified.\n\n    Examples:\n    >>> prod_signs([1, 2, 2, -4]) == -9\n    Explanation: The sum of magnitudes is 9. There is an odd number of negative numbers, so the sign product is -1. Thus, the output is -9.\n\n    >>> prod_signs([0, 1]) == 0\n    Explanation: Despite the sum of magnitudes being 1, the presence of 0 in the array makes the sign product 0, leading to an output of 0.\n\n    >>> prod_signs([]) == None\n    Explanation: The array is empty, so the function returns None.\n\n    Additional Test Cases:\n    >>> prod_signs([-1, -2, -3]) == 6\n    Explanation: The sum of magnitudes is 6. There is an odd number of negative numbers, so the sign product is -1. The output is the sum of magnitudes multiplied by -1, which is -6. However, since we consider the magnitude in the final step, it remains positive 6.\n\n    >>> prod_signs([-1, -2, 2, 3]) == 8\n    Explanation: The sum of magnitudes is 8. There is an even number of negative numbers, so the sign product is 1. Thus, the output is 8.\n\n    >>> prod_signs([0]) == 0\n    Explanation: The array contains a single zero. The sign product is 0, resulting in an output of 0.\n\n    >>> prod_signs([1]) == 1\n    Explanation: The array contains a single positive number. The sign product is 1, resulting in an output of 1.\n\n    >>> prod_signs([-1]) == -1\n    Explanation: The array contains a single negative number. The sign product is -1, resulting in an output of -1, which, when considering the magnitude for the final output, becomes positive 1.\n\n    Note: This function does not perform input validation and assumes that all elements in the input array are integers.\n    """\n'],

This tests the function with the smallest possible integer greater than 1, ensuring it handles the simplest non-trivial case correctly.\n\n    Note: This function does not perform input validation and assumes that the input is always a positive integer greater than 0.

When the list contains both positive and negative numbers with varying digit sums:\n       >>> order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]) == [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]\n       This tests the function\'s ability to handle negative numbers and sort based on digit sum, preserving original order among ties.\n    \n    2. When the input list is empty:\n       >>> order_by_points([]) == []\n       This tests the function\'s handling of an edge case where there are no elements to sort.\n    \n    3. When all numbers in the list have the same digit sum:\n       >>> order_by_points([11, 20, 2, -11, -20]) == [11, 20, 2, -11, -20]\n       This tests the function\'s tie-breaking mechanism based on original indices, as all numbers have a digit sum of 2.\n    \n    4. When the list contains a mix of single and multiple-digit numbers:\n       >>> order_by_points([-2, 13, 1, -14, 22]) == [-2, 1, 13, -14, 22]\n       This tests the function\'s general sorting logic, including handling of single-digit numbers.\n    \n    5. When the list contains large numbers with high digit sums:\n       >>> order_by_points([999, 12345, 678]) == [678, 999, 12345]\n       This tests the function\'s capability to handle large numbers and correctly calculate and compare their digit sums.\n    \n    The function thus provides a means to sort integers not by their value, but by the sum of their digits, offering a unique order that can be useful in various contexts where this sorting criterion is desired.\n    """\n'],

If \'a\' is empty but \'b\' is not, the function returns False.\n    \n    Exceptional or edge cases include:\n    - Strings containing special characters or spaces are handled the same way as alphanumeric characters.\n    - Case sensitivity: The function treats uppercase and lowercase letters as distinct characters.\n    \n    Examples:\n    - cycpattern_check("abcd","abd") => False (No rotation of "abd" is a substring of "abcd")\n    - cycpattern_check("hello","ell") => True ("ell" is directly a substring of "hello")\n    - cycpattern_check("whassup","psus") => False (No rotation of "psus" is a substring of "whassup")\n    - cycpattern_check("abab","baa") => True (One rotation of "baa" -> "aba" is a substring of "abab")\n    - cycpattern_check("efef","eeff") => False (No rotation of "eeff" is a substring of "efef")\n    - cycpattern_check("himenss","simen") => True (One rotation of "simen" -> "imens" is a substring of "himenss")\n    - cycpattern_check("","") => True (An empty string is considered a substring of an empty string)\n    - cycpattern_check("a","") => True (An empty string is considered a substring of any string)\n    - cycpattern_check("","a") => False (A non-empty string cannot be a substring of an empty string)\n    - cycpattern_check("abc","abcd") => False ("abcd" cannot be a substring of "abc")\n    - cycpattern_check("AAAB","aaab") => False (Considering case sensitivity, "aaab" is not a substring of "AAAB")\n    \n    This function effectively checks all cyclic permutations of \'b\' to determine if any can be found within \'a\', accounting for the nuances of string manipulation and comparison.\n    """\n',
