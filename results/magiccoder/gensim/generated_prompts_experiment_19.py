On this road, there are two sets of cars. One set consists of \'n\' cars moving from left to right, and simultaneously, another set of \'n\' cars moves from right to left. The cars start far apart from each other but are moving towards each other at the same speed. When a car moving in one direction collides with a car moving in the opposite direction, it is counted as a collision. Despite these collisions, the cars are indestructible and continue their journey unaffected, maintaining their speed and direction as if the collision never happened.\n\n    The function aims to compute the total number of such collisions that will occur until all cars have passed each other.
