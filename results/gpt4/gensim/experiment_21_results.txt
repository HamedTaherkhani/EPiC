The input string (paren_string) \n    consists of multiple groups of nested parentheses, possibly with spaces. The goal of the function is to identify \n    and separate these groups of parentheses into individual strings, ensuring that each group is balanced and not \n    nested within another group. The function ignores any spaces in the input string.\n\n    Input:\n    - paren_string (str): A string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses, with or without spaces.\n\n    Output:\n    - List[str]: A list of strings, where each string is a group of balanced parentheses extracted from the input.\n\n    The function works by iterating over the characters in the input string, tracking the depth of nesting with a \n    counter. When the counter is increased (an opening parenthesis is encountered) or decreased (a closing parenthesis \n    is encountered), the function keeps track of the current group of parentheses. Once a group is completed (the \n    counter returns to zero), it is added to the output list. Spaces in the input string are ignored.\n\n    Exceptional or Edge Cases:\n    1.

The bucket used for extracting\n    water has a fixed capacity, and it can be used to remove water from any well.\n\n    Input:\n        grid (List[List[int]]): A 2D list representing the grid of wells, where each row corresponds\n                                to a well and each \'1\' in a row represents a unit of water in that well.\n        capacity (int): The capacity of the bucket used to extract water, indicating the maximum\n                        number of water units it can remove in a single use.\n\n    Output:\n        int: The minimum number of times the bucket needs to be lowered to empty all the wells.\n\n    The function works under the assumption that all wells (rows in the grid) have the same length,\n    and the input grid and capacity follow the constraints provided. The function iterates through\n    each well, counting the units of water, and then calculates the number of times the bucket needs\n    to be lowered based on its capacity. The calculation takes into account the total water units in\n    each well and the bucket\'s capacity, using ceiling division to ensure that even if a well has less\n    water than the bucket\'s capacity, it counts as one bucket lowering operation.\n\n    Exceptional or edge cases include:\n    - Wells with no water: If a well contains no water (i.e., all \'0\'s in a row), it does not contribute\n      to the bucket lowering count.\n    - Bucket capacity larger than the total water in a well: If the bucket\'s capacity is larger than the\n      total units of water in a well, the bucket only needs to be lowered once for that well.\n    - Empty grid or all wells empty: If the grid is empty or all wells have no water, the output is 0\n      as no bucket lowering is needed.\n\n    Examples:\n    1. grid = [[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]], capacity = 1 => Output: 6\n    2. grid = [[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]], capacity = 2 => Output: 5\n    3. grid = [[0,0,0], [0,0,0]], capacity = 5 => Output: 0\n    4. grid = [[1,1,1,1], [1,1,1,1]], capacity = 4 => Output: 2 (All water in each well fits the bucket perfectly)\n    5. grid = [[1,0,1], [1,1,0]], capacity = 3 => Output: 2 (Bucket capacity equals total water in each well)\n    6. grid = [], capacity = 1 => Output: 0 (Empty grid case)\n    7. grid = [[0,0,0,0]], capacity = 2 => Output: 0 (Single well with no water)\n\n    The function does not perform input validation and assumes that the input meets the constraints specified.\n    """#SPECIAL_TOKEN\n    total_times = 0\n    for well in grid:\n        water_units = sum(well)\n        total_times += math.ceil(water_units / capacity)\n    return total_times\n', '\ndef sort_array(arr):\n    """#SPECIAL_TOKEN\n    In this Kata, you have to sort an array of non-negative integers according to\n    number of ones in their binary representation in ascending order.\n    For similar number of ones, sort based on decimal value.\n\n    It must be implemented like this:\n    >>> sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    >>> sort_array([-2, -3, -4, -5, -6]) == [-6, -5, -4, -3, -2]\n    >>> sort_array([1, 0, 2, 3, 4]) [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n    """#SPECIAL_TOKEN\n\n\ndef sort_array(arr):\n    # Sort the array based on the number of ones in their binary representation\n    # In case of a tie, sort based on the decimal value\n    return sorted(arr, key=lambda x: (bin(x).count(\'1\'), x))\n', '\ndef select_words(s, n):\n    """#SPECIAL_TOKENGiven a string s and a natural number n, you have been tasked to implement \n    a function that returns a list of all words from string s that contain exactly \n    n consonants, in order these words appear in the string s.\n    If the string s is empty then the function should return an empty list.\n    Note: you may assume the input string contains only letters and spaces.\n    Examples:\n    select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4) ==> ["little"]\n    select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 3) ==> ["Mary", "lamb"]\n    select_words("simple white space", 2) ==> []\n    select_words("Hello world", 4) ==> ["world"]\n    select_words("Uncle sam", 3) ==> ["Uncle"]\n    """#SPECIAL_TOKEN\n\n\ndef select_words(s, n):\n    vowels = \'aeiouAEIOU\'\n    words = s.split()\n    result = []\n    for word in words:\n        consonants = [char for char in word if char not in vowels]\n        if len(consonants) == n:\n            result.append(word)\n    return result\n', 'def get_closest_vowel(word: str) -> str:\n    """#SPECIAL_TOKEN\n    Given a string \'word\' as input, this function finds and returns the closest vowel \n    (a, e, i, o, u, A, E, I, O, U) that is positioned between two consonants within the \n    word, starting the search from the right side (end) of the word.
